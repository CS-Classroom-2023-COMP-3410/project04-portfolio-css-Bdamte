I had some trouble really understanding what i wanted for my desgin to look like. 
I went to bulma to see what examples they had and how to use the frame work and I tried to make my own nav bar at first(it was good but the one they offered was so much better.) 
I manily used the card class as that was what i wanted and it looked nice so that was a plus. It was also easy to implement, once i did it once it was easy to add it somewhere else.
I had insane trouble with responsiveness, i made the website trying to do the desktop version first. 
Not a good idea, but I did try to fix it and I would have trouble with the content adjusting for size.
It would be fine with the phone version but it would shrink when it goes bigger width. I tried so many things and I went to the webversion to play with the developer tools and I found out it was inherting the width of its previous but idk how that happened and I asked gpt where this was and it was like just override it.
 So I did just that and now it works.
